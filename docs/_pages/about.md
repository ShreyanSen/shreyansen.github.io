Welcome! I'm a data scientist, mindfulness and yoga instructor, and general tinkerer. 

Like many people I've lived a few different lives. Born in Calcutta and raised in North Dakota, I was packed off to college at 16. I studied Physics with a side of English at Duke, but quit physics to join the Peace Corps where I lived and worked for two years in a village in Guinea, West Africa. After that I worked on water and sanitation systems in Kenya and Bangladesh as a graduate student at Stanford, where I won an NSF GFRP. I couldn't make it into the research group I wanted so I pivoted back into the math world, leaving Stanford with Masters degrees in Statistics and Environmental Engineering, and became a data scientist just like everyone else. I learned a lot about the field during my first five years at startups. At the end of the pandemic the travel bug bit, so I stayed remote and went digital nomad. After I lost my job in a round of layoffs in 2023 I went traveling full-time, wandering Central America, Asia, and Europe. I deepened my practice with my [Zen teacher](http://jion-blonstein.com/), became a yoga teacher in Rishikesh, and wrote a lot of code. I wrote code to prove to myself I could. I wrote code to practice making things that wanted to be made. I wrote code to rediscover coding and math as a form of self-expression arising from the selfless self.

"To carry yourself forward and experience myriad things is delusion. That
myriad things come forth and experience themselves is awakening."

Dogen, Genjokoan.
