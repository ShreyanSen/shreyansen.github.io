Welcome! I am Shreyan Sen, a data scientist, certified mindfulness and yoga instructor, and general tinkerer.

I was born in Kolkata, India, and my family immigrated to the United States when I was 2. I spent many of my early years living in Fargo, ND and suffered from acute nerdiness, skipping 2 grades for no reason. After completing my B.S. in Physics at Duke University, I served as a U.S. Peace Corps Volunteer in rural Guinea. It was a life-changing experience, cementing my desire to be of some use to others. Next I enrolled at Stanford University as a graduate student in Environmental Engineering, studying water and sanitation in the context of international development. I remember my time at Stanford as one of both great beauty and great difficulty, and I was unable to complete my PhD. Instead I finished an M.S. in Statistics and pivoted into data science. For two years I worked at a geospatial / IoT (Internet of Things) company before returning to the impact sector, working at an air quality monitoring startup which also ran an IoT sensor network stack. I was laid off in 2023, allowing me to spend the next year traveling the world. By this time my personal interest in contemplative practice had already sprouted. I completed a 200-hour yoga teacher training in Rishikesh, the birthplace of yoga, complementing a 75-hour mindfulness instructor training I'd completed in 2022. However, the core of my ongoing practice centers around my training with [Zen Master & Therapist Jion](http://jion-blonstein.com/)

Today I work at yet another IoT sensor network company, still in the impact sector, this time working with the electrical grid. Though I get to spend my time on many things I particularly enjoy writing, movement, and bansuri. Bring something to my attention; let's work together.
