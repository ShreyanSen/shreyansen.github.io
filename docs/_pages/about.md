Welcome! I'm Shreyan Sen, a data scientist and mindfulness instructor. This is my personal site, where you'll find paths to various projects I'm working on. I enjoy writing, flute, and tea.

This page is called Original Mind. Why? To serve as an Original ReMinder.

â€œYou should therefore cease from practice based on intellectual understanding, pursuing words and following after speech, and learn the backward step that turns your light inwardly to illuminate your self. Body and mind of themselves will drop away, and your original face will be manifest."

-Dogen
