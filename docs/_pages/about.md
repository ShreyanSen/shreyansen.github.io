Welcome! I am Shreyan Sen, a data scientist, certified mindfulness and yoga instructor, and general tinkerer. Let me tell you my story.

Like many people I've lived a few different lives. Born in Calcutta and raised in North Dakota, I was packed off to college at 16. I studied Physics with a side of English at Duke, but didn't feel like a strong enough physicist to keep pursuing it. Instead I joined the Peace Corps where I lived and worked for two years in a village in Guinea, West Africa. Next I attended Stanford as a graduate student, where I won a prestigious NSF GRFP and worked on water and sanitation systems in Kenya and Bangladesh. I couldn't make it into the research group I wanted so I pivoted back into the math world, leaving Stanford with Masters degrees in Statistics and Environmental Engineering. 

For the next 5 years I worked as a Data Scientist at well-funded geospatial and climate startups, deepening my statistical knowledge and learning foundational software development skills. When remote work blossomed and we came out of the pandemic, I let my San Francisco lease expire and tried the digital nomad lifestyle. After I lost my job to a round of layoffs in 2023 I began traveling full-time, wandering Central America, Asia, and Europe. I deepened my practice with my [Zen teacher](http://jion-blonstein.com/), completed my yoga teacher training in Rishikesh, and wrote a lot of code. I wrote code to prove to myself I could. I wrote code to practice making things that wanted to be made. I wrote code to rediscover coding and math as a form of self-expression arising from the selfless self.
