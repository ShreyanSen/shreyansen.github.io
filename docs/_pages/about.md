Welcome! I'm a data scientist, mindfulness and yoga instructor, and general tinkerer. I like to put linux on old laptops nobody uses anymore. It must be that I have a soft spot for useless old things. There's a story about an old redwood who was too bent and twisted to make for good lumber. Being useless, it missed the axe that took the rest of its forest. Now children play in its shade.

"To carry yourself forward and experience myriad things is delusion. That
myriad things come forth and experience themselves is awakening."

Dogen, Genjokoan.
