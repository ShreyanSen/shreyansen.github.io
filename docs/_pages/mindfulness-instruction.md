What is mindfulness?

Mindfulness is a fusion of two key elements: awareness / attention and acceptance / non-judgment. Let's try it. Now that I've told you to notice your tongue, you're aware of it. If there's an energy of neutral non-judgment to that noticing, then this is mindfulness. Neutrality doesn't require flavorlessness; if you had a drop of honey on your tongue, you'd probably be feeling some sweetness and some pleasure. There's a part of you who is aware of that sweetness, aware of that pleasure, and maybe even aware of judging that experience as positive or negative (or both!); but the awareness is not the sweetness, it is not the pleasure, and it is not the judging either.

Now pause, and notice.

Well done! You just experienced a tiny journey into the world of mindfulness. But what's all the buzz about? Why is it so popular?

Various forms of mindfulness have been explored by many cultures, but much of what we hear about mindfulness today is rooted in ancient Hindu and Buddhist practices from Asia. Monastic and ascetic traditions in India used mindfulness practice as part of a broader program to find spiritual awakening. Today, people still engage with these traditions, which have crossed continents as they were passed down from Teacher to Student for thousands of years.

In the West, modern mindfulness has also secularized and split off from its roots. In the 1970s, Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn took his experiences with mindfulness and developed them into a program called [Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/crisis-knocks/201003/mindfulness-based-stress-reduction-what-it-is-how-it-helps), which brought mindfulness into the medical world as a treatment for conditions linked to stress--which is many of them! Since then a great deal of academic research has been done on mindfulness, and today mindfulness is used by hospitals around the world to support people suffering from anxiety, depression, stress, and chronic pain.

While mindfulness is clearly useful for spirituality and health, it has other uses as well. Maybe you want to understand yourself better and see what triggers you or makes you happy. Maybe you want to learn how to stand up for yourself. Maybe you want to have more stability when you feel overwhelmed or angry. Maybe you want to experience deeper connections with your loved ones. Maybe you want to feel more confident in the workplace. Maybe you are processing grief. Maybe you're just curious. Everyone has their own reason for engaging with mindfulness, and these reasons can change.

It's important to understand that mindfulness is not a cure-all, nor does it always generate a helpful or pleasant experience. If you were to get a papercut, mindfulness of your pain might not make it go away--you might feel even more pain as you focus on it. Sometimes it's better to take an ibuprofen than to use mindfulness. Psychological pain is no different. Mindfulness of trauma can trigger adverse experiences. This is part of the reason having a good mindfulness instructor or mindfulness community is a big support. It takes time to learn how to practice mindfulness well, when to push yourself, when to slow down, and how to create the spaciousness, insight, and freedom that mindfulness supports.

Whether you are totally new to mindfulness or a seasoned sitter, it would be my honor to serve as your Mindfulness Instructor and share with you some of what I've been taught.

# Meet Your Mindfulness Instructor

I first sat in meditation over ten years ago. Since 2020 my personal practice has greatly strengthened as I've practiced in community and at mindfulness retreats as part of Thich Nhat Hanh's [Plum Village](https://plumvillage.org/#filter=.region-na) tradition. In 2022 I completed a Certified Mindfulness Instructor course created by the renowned [Rev. angel Kyodo williams](https://revangel.com/), the second Black woman in history to be authorized to teach Zen and author of Radical Dharma: Talking Race, Love, and Liberation. Since May of 2022 I have had the good fortune to train under [Zen Master Jion](http://jion-blonstein.com/).
